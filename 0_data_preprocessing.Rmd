## 1. Introduction

This document describes the data preprocessing phase of the project. The goal is to clean and transform the raw data into a format that can be used for the analysis. The data used in this project are the following:

- **NYPD Shooting Incident Data**: contains information about shooting incidents in New York City in the period 2006-2023. The dataset is available at NYC Data portal at the follwing [resource](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8).
- **NYPD Arrest Data**: contains information about arrests in New York City in the period 2006-2023. The dataset is available at NYC Data portal at the following [resource](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u).

The preprocissing has the goal of build a monthly dataset specifying the number of **shootings** and arrests for each borough and **crime type**.

```

## 2. Shootings data

We load and preprocess the **shootings dataset** [`shootings.csv`](/data/shooting.csv) and we crate the columns suitable for aggregation purposes.

```{r load shootings}

shootings <- read.csv(PATHS$Shootings)

```

```{r shootings type casting}

# Keep columns of interest
shootings <- shootings[, SHOOTINGS_COLS]

# Cast to date and time type
shootings$OCCUR_DATE <- as.Date(shootings$OCCUR_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Cast Borough to factor
shootings$Borough <- as.factor(shootings$BORO)
shootings$BORO    <- NULL

# Extract time features
shootings$Year  <- as.numeric(format(shootings$OCCUR_DATE, "%Y"))
shootings$Month <- as.numeric(format(shootings$OCCUR_DATE, "%m"))

# Save the first and last date
date.first <- min(shootings$OCCUR_DATE)
date.last  <- max(shootings$OCCUR_DATE)

shootings$OCCUR_DATE <- NULL

head(shootings)
summary(shootings)
```

We aggregate the shootings data by year, month and Borough to have a count of shootings for each month and borough.

```{r shootings month aggregation}

# Create a new dataset counting how many arrests in each month
shootings_month <- aggregate(
    INCIDENT_KEY ~ Borough + Month + Year,
    data = shootings,
    FUN  = length
)

# Change count colname
names(shootings_month)[4] <- "Shootings"

# Create a dummy dataset to fill missing months with no shooting
shootings_month_dummy <- expand.grid(
    OCCUR_DATE     = seq(date.first, date.last, by = "month"),
    Borough        = levels(shootings$Borough),
    ShootingsDummy = 0
)

# Cast to the appropriate type
shootings_month_dummy$OCCUR_DATE <- as.Date(shootings_month_dummy$OCCUR_DATE, format="%m/%d/%Y")
shootings_month_dummy$Year       <- as.numeric(format(shootings_month_dummy$OCCUR_DATE, "%Y"))
shootings_month_dummy$Month      <- as.numeric(format(shootings_month_dummy$OCCUR_DATE, "%m"))
shootings_month_dummy$OCCUR_DATE <- NULL

# Merge the two datasets
shootings_month <- merge(
    shootings_month,
    shootings_month_dummy,
    by  = c("Borough", "Year", "Month"),
    all = TRUE # Produce NAN for missing values
)

# Fill missing values with 0
shootings_month$Shootings[is.na(shootings_month$Shootings)] <- 0
shootings_month$ShootingsDummy <- NULL
rm(shootings_month_dummy)

head(shootings_month)
```

The final dataset consists of `r nrow(shootings_month)` rows and `r ncol(shootings_month)` columns. Each row represent:

- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Borough))` different boroughs in column `Borough`.
- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Month))` months in column `Month`.
- `r max(shootings_month$Year) - min(shootings_month$Year) + 1` years, from `r min(shootings_month$Year)` to `r max(shootings_month$Year)`, in column `Year`

The feature `Shootings` represent the number of shootings in the considered area and period.

Here's the final summary of the dataset.

```{r shootings month summary}

summary(shootings_month)

```


## 3. Arrests data

As we did for the shooting data, we load and preprocess the **arrests dataset** [`arrests.csv`](/data/arrests.csv) and we crate the columns suitable for aggregation purposes. In addition to the year, month and borough, we also need to take in consideration the specific **crime type** the arrest occured.
We only keep the type of crimes most frequent fifteen and possibily related with shootings. The crime types are the following : Assuault, Marijuana possesion and sell, Theft, Firearm, SubstancePossession, Robbery, Weapons possesion, Drug paraphernalia, Larceny, Mischief, Trepass, Burglary, Bribery, Murder and Forgery.


```{r load arrests}

arrests <- read.csv(PATHS$Arrests)

```

```{r arrests}

# Keep columns of interest
arrests <- arrests[, ARRESTS_COLS]

# Map categories to specified class
# and remove rows with other categories
for (crime in names(CRIME_TYPES)) {
    arrests$PD_DESC[arrests$PD_DESC %in% CRIME_TYPES[[crime]]] <- crime
}
arrests <- arrests[(arrests$PD_DESC %in% names(CRIME_TYPES)), ]

# Map boroughs to same name as shootings
arrests$ARREST_BORO <- BOROUGH_LETTER_MAP[arrests$ARREST_BORO]

# Cast to date 
arrests$ARREST_DATE  <- as.Date  (arrests$ARREST_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
arrests$Year         <- as.numeric(format(arrests$ARREST_DATE, "%Y"))
arrests$Month        <- as.numeric(format(arrests$ARREST_DATE, "%m"))
arrests$Borough      <- as.factor(arrests$ARREST_BORO)
arrests$Crime        <- as.factor(arrests$PD_DESC)
arrests$PD_DESC      <- NULL
arrests$ARREST_DATE  <- NULL
arrests$ARREST_BORO  <- NULL

head(arrests)
summary(arrests)

```

We aggregate the arrests to have a count of arrests for each month, borough and crime.

```{r arrests month aggregation}

# Create a new dataset counting how many arrests in each month
arrests_month <- aggregate(
    ARREST_KEY ~ Borough + Month + Year + Crime,
    data = arrests,
    FUN  = length
)
# Set count colname
names(arrests_month)[5] <- "Arrests"

# Merge with a dummy dataset to fill in missing months
dummy_arrests_month <- expand.grid(
    OCCUR_DATE   = seq(date.first, date.last, by = "month"),
    Borough      = levels(arrests$Borough),
    Crime        = levels(arrests$Crime),
    ArrestsDummy = 0
)

# Cast to the appropriate type
dummy_arrests_month$OCCUR_DATE <- as.Date          (dummy_arrests_month$OCCUR_DATE, format="%m/%d/%Y")
dummy_arrests_month$Year       <- as.numeric(format(dummy_arrests_month$OCCUR_DATE, "%Y"))
dummy_arrests_month$Month      <- as.numeric(format(dummy_arrests_month$OCCUR_DATE, "%m"))
dummy_arrests_month$OCCUR_DATE <- NULL

# Merge the two datasets
arrests_month <- merge(
    arrests_month,
    dummy_arrests_month,
    by  = c("Borough", "Year", "Month", "Crime"),
    all = TRUE # Produce NAN for missing values
)

# Fill missing values with 0
arrests_month$Arrests[is.na(arrests_month$Arrests)] <- 0
arrests_month$ArrestsDummy <- NULL

head(arrests_month)

```

The final dataset consists of $16200$ rows and $5$ columns. Each row represent:

- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Borough))` different boroughs in column `Borough`.
- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Month))` months in column `Month`.
- `r max(shootings_month$Year) - min(shootings_month$Year) + 1` years, from `r min(shootings_month$Year)` to `r max(shootings_month$Year)`, in column `Year`.
- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Crimes))` different crime types in column `Crime`.

The `Arrests` feature represent the number of arrests in the considered area and period.

However we prefer to rehsape the dataset to use the crime type as column in order to make the dataset suitable for the merge with shooting one.

```{r arrests reshaping}

# Reorganaize the dataset using Crime as column
arrests_month <- reshape(
    arrests_month,
    idvar = c("Borough", "Year", "Month"),
    timevar = "Crime",
    direction = "wide"
)
names(arrests_month) <- gsub("Arrests.", "", names(arrests_month))

# Add a column with the total number of arrests
arrests_month$TotArrests <- rowSums(arrests_month[, 4:ncol(arrests_month)], na.rm = TRUE)

head(arrests_month)
```

The final summary of the dataset is the following.

```{r arrests month summary}

summary(arrests_month)

```

## 4. Merge datasets

We merge the two datasets to have a unique dataset with the number of shootings and arrests for each borough, month and crime type. We also create an artificial borough **NewYork** accounting for the total number of shootings and crimes in the city.

```{r merge datasets}

# Merge arrests and shootings
nyc_month_crimes <- merge(
    arrests_month,
    shootings_month, 
    by = c("Borough", "Year", "Month"), 
    all = TRUE
)

# Sort rows by Borough, Year and Month
nyc_month_crimes <- nyc_month_crimes[
    order(
        nyc_month_crimes$Borough, 
        nyc_month_crimes$Year,
        nyc_month_crimes$Month
    ), 
]

nyc_month_crimes$Borough <- BOROUGH_LOWERCASE_MAP[nyc_month_crimes$Borough]
nyc_month_crimes$Borough <- as.factor(nyc_month_crimes$Borough)

head(nyc_month_crimes)

```

The final dataset has `r nrow(nyc_month_crimes)` rows and `r ncol(nyc_month_crimes)` columns. Each row represent:


- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Borough))` different boroughs in column `Borough`.
- `r length(unique(shootings_month$Month))` months in column `Month`.
- `r max(shootings_month$Year) - min(shootings_month$Year) + 1` years, from `r min(shootings_month$Year)` to `r max(shootings_month$Year)`, in column `Year`.
- `r 15` different crime columns, plus their total in column `TotArrests`.
- The `Shootings` feature represent the number of shootings in the considered area and period.


```{r save datasets}

summary(nyc_month_crimes)

# Save the datasets
write.csv(nyc_month_crimes, PATHS$NycMonthCrimes, row.names = FALSE)

```

We save the dataset for the analysis in the [`nyc_month_crimes.csv`](/data/nyc_month_crimes.csv) file.
