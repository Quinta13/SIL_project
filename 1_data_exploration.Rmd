## 1. Introduction

This notebook is designed to conduct an exploratory data analysis prior to the main analyses. The primary objective is to understand the structure of the data and the relationships between variables. 

A better understanding of the data will undoubtedly lead to a better comprehension of the results obtained during the modeling phase. Additionally, it will provide valuable insights that can improve the modeling process.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# 1. RMardown styling
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.align='center')

# 2. Project environment setup
source("src/init.R")

```


### 1.1. Data preparation

To begin, we will read the data produced by an initial data preparation phase carried out in this other notebook [`0_data_preprocessing.Rmd`](./0_data_preprocessing.Rmd).

```{r}

# Load data
crimes <- read.csv(PATHS$NycMonthCrimes)

```

The dataset has $`r nrow(crimes)`$ rows and $`r ncol(crimes)`$ columns. Here is a brief overview of the first few rows.

```{r}

head(crimes)

```

We make some preliminary modifications to the dataset to make it more suitable for analysis.

- We treat the `Borough` column as a categorical variable to investigate whether patterns emerge based on different districts.
- We add a `MonthName` column, a categorical version of the `Month` column, allowing us to treat the months in a non-linear manner.
- From the perspective of predicting shootings, using the number of arrests in the same month can sometimes be trivial and unrealistic in a real-world scenario. Therefore, we modify the variables by using the number of arrests from the previous month as a predictor. This operation invalidates the first row of our dataset, January 1, 2006, which must be discarded.
- We add a `T` column that represents the time elapsed in months from the first month of the dataset (February 2006). This helps model the temporal dependence of the observations. Additionally, we add two columns, `SinT` and `CosT`, representing the sine and cosine transformations of `T` with a periodicity of 12, useful for modeling seasonality.

All these operations will also be performed in the two notebooks focusing on statistical analyses.


```{r}

prepare_out <- prepare_crimes(crimes_df=crimes, use_families=FALSE)
crimes      <- prepare_out$df

rm(prepare_out)

```

Let's take a brief look at the dataset after the aforementioned modifications.

```{r}

head(crimes, 25)
summary(crimes)

```


### 1.2. Train and Test split

Before proceeding with the exploration, it is essential to adhere to the statistical and machine learning paradigm, which involves splitting the dataset into two parts: a training set and a test set. The test set simulates new, unseen data during the fitting phase and allows us to evaluate the model's performance on new data. For this reason, the exploration will focus solely on the training set.

Given the temporal nature of the data, the split cannot be arbitrary but must account for the intrinsic temporal dependencies of the observations. Therefore, the dataset will be divided into two parts based on the year of observation, using the last two years, 2022 and 2023, as the test set.

The temporal dependency complicates the application of the cross-validation paradigm, which achieves a more robust result by dividing the dataset into folds and repeatedly performing the same analysis, rotating the fold considered as the test set. Although cross-validation theoretically allows for a more robust and comprehensive modeling, it is not applicable in this case due to the temporal dependence of the observations. Therefore, the entire statistical analysis will rely solely on the fixed split between the training and test sets.

```{r}

# Split Train and Test
split <- train_test_split_by_year(
    df_=crimes, 
    year_test=YEAR_TEST
)

crimes      <- split$train
crimes_test <- split$test

rm(split)

```

After performing the split, the training set contains $`r nrow(crimes)`$ rows, while the test set contains $`r nrow(crimes_test)`$ rows.

---

## 2. Visualizations

As a first step in data exploration, we will proceed with a series of visualizations that will provide an overview of the involved variables and their relationships.

### 2.1. Time series

First, let's visualize the time series of the variables involved, particularly how shootings and different types of crimes have varied over time and whether any interactions between them can be observed.

```{r}

plot_multiple_ts(
    df_ts = ts_crimes_reshape(
        df_ = aggregate(
            . ~ Year + MonthName,
            data = crimes[, c("Year", "MonthName", CRIME_NAMES, "Shootings")], # Remove Borough, Month, TotArrests
            FUN = sum
        )
    ),
    group  = "CrimeType",
    xlab   = "Year",
    ylab   = "Incidents",
    title  = "Criminality in NYC - 2006 to 2021 ",
    lwd    = 0.7,
    ticks  = 7,
    colors = PALETTE$crimes,
    legend.size = 10
)

```

This initial type of visualization provides an overview that can give a first idea about crimes magnitude and variation over time.

- There are crimes that are much more frequent, such as `MarijuanaPossession` and `SubstancePossesion`, which have seen a drastic decrease over the years. Others, like `Assault`, have maintained a more stable trend over time.
- Some crimes show certain trends, such as `Theft`, which gradually increased starting in 2010 and then saw a decline from 2016. Another crime with a more complex pattern is `Larceny`, which in 2014 appears to have experienced a rapid and drastic change in arrest numbers, followed by a reset in 2020.
- Arrests for `LicnesingFirearm` have a very low number of arrests, with many months registering no arrests for this crime.
- Patterns of other crimes are harder to discern from this graph due to their smaller magnitude, including our target variable `Shootings`.

In this regard, it makes sense to visualize each time series independently. Let's take this opportunity to visualize the same time series for the five different boroughs of New York, to appreciate if there are significant differences among them.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=10}

BOROUGH_LEGEND <- extract_legend(

    plot_multiple_ts(
        df_ts = ts_borough_reshape(
            df_ = crimes[, c("Borough", "Year", "MonthName", "Shootings")],
            crime_type = "Shootings"
        ),
        group  = "Borough",
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab   = "Arrests",
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.size = 10,
        colors=unlist(PALETTE$boroughs)
    )

)

plot_in_grid <- function(plot_list, ncol = 1, title = "", title.size=15, height = 0.4) {

    to_plot <- c(plot_list, list(BOROUGH_LEGEND))

    nplots <- length(plot_list)
    nrow <- ceiling(nplots / ncol)

    # Create the layout matrix
    layout_matrix <- matrix(seq(1, nrow * ncol), nrow = nrow, ncol = ncol, byrow = TRUE)
    layout_matrix <- rbind(layout_matrix, rep(max(layout_matrix, na.rm = TRUE) + 1, ncol))


    return(grid.arrange(
        grobs = to_plot,
        ncol = ncol,
        top = textGrob(
            title, 
            gp = gpar(fontsize = title.size, fontface = "bold")),
            layout_matrix = layout_matrix,
            heights = c(rep(1, nrow), height)  # Adjust the relative height for the legend row
    ))

}
```

#### 2.1.1 Arrests

Now let's examine the trends of the time series for different types of crimes.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}

ts_plots <- list()

for (i in 1:length(CRIME_NAMES)) {

    crime_name <- CRIME_NAMES[i]

    ts_plots[[crime_name]] <- plot_multiple_ts(
        df_ts = ts_borough_reshape(
            df_ = crimes[, c("Borough", "Year", "MonthName", crime_name)],
            crime_type = crime_name
        ),
        ylab   = ifelse((i-1) %% 4 == 0, "Arrests", ""),
        group  = "Borough",
        title  = paste(crime_name),
        lwd    = 0.5,
        colors = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs),
        ticks  = 3,
        legend = FALSE,
        title_size = 11
    )

}


plot_in_grid(
    plot_list = ts_plots,
    ncol = 4,
    title = "Crimes in NYC - 2006 to 2021"
)

rm(ts_plots)

```

The plots reveal a noticeable trend for different types of crimes. While some types show more variability than others, most exhibit a declining trend starting from 2018.

Regarding the division among boroughs, the trend appears consistent but operates at different levels: Brooklyn and the Bronx tend to have higher crime rates compared to Queens and Manhattan. A notable exception is Staten Island, which appears to be an area with lower crime rates and shows little clear trend over time.

#### 2.1.2 Shootings and Total Arrests

Now let's visualize the time series for shootings, our response variable, and the total arrests that aggregate all the types of crimes seen previously.

```{r}

ts_plots <- list()

for (crime_name in c("TotArrests", "Shootings")) {

    ts_plots[[crime_name]] <- plot_multiple_ts(
        df_ts = ts_borough_reshape(
            df_ = crimes[, c("Borough", "Year", "MonthName", crime_name)],
            crime_type = crime_name
        ),
        group  = "Borough",
        xlab   = "Year",
        ylab   = ifelse(crime_name=="Shootings", "Shootings Incidents", "Total Arrests"),
        title  = paste(crime_name),
        lwd    = 0.6,
        colors = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs),
        ticks  = 8,
        legend = FALSE
    )

}

plot_in_grid(
    plot_list = ts_plots,
    ncol = 2,
    title = "Arrests and Shootings in NYC - 2006 to 2021",
    height = 0.1,
    title.size = 20
)

rm(ts_plots)

```

Arrests summarize somewhat what was seen previously, showing a declining trend starting from 2018 that remains consistent across all boroughs, albeit at different levels.

Shootings, on the other hand, appear to have a relatively stable trend with a dip in 2018 and a peak in 2020. Shootings seem similar between the Bronx and Brooklyn, as well as between Queens and Manhattan. Staten Island, however, remains an area with few shootings.


### 2.2 Scatterplots

Let's proceed with a second visualization using a scatter plot to better appreciate the relationships between the predictor variables for our prediction model and the response variable, which is the number of shootings.

#### 2.2.1. Month and Year
```{r}

BOROUGH_LEGEND <- extract_legend(

    levels_scatterplot(
        df_     = crimes,
        x       = "Year",
        y       = "Shootings",
        levels  = "Borough",
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.size      = 13,
        colors = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs)
    )

)

time_scatterplots <- list()

# Plots
for (time in c("Year", "Month")) {
    time_scatterplots[[time]] <- levels_scatterplot(
        df_     = crimes,
        x       = time,
        y       = "Shootings",
        levels  = "Borough",
        title   = paste("Shootings by", time),
        title_size = 12,
        jitter_ = TRUE,
        ticks   = ifelse(time=="Month", 12, 5),
        shape   = 19,
        size    = 1,
        colors  = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs),
        legend  = FALSE,
        ylab    = ifelse(time=="Year", "Shootings incidents", "")
    )
}

plot_in_grid(
    plot_list = time_scatterplots,
    ncol = 2,
    title = "Shootings in NYC over time",
    title.size = 20,
    height = 0.1
)

rm(time_scatterplots)

```

Two trends emerge:

* Regarding the `Year` predictor, the information observed aligns closely with the time series: there is a common trend across boroughs showing a decrease from 2010 to 2018, followed by a rise.
* The scatter plot involving the `Month` shows a clear seasonal dependence, with a peak in shootings during the summer months and a more pronounced decline in winter, particularly in February. Additionally, boroughs with higher numbers of shootings also exhibit greater variability.

#### 2.2.2. Arrests

Let's investigate the relationship between the number of arrests for a given crime and shootings.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=10}

arrests_scatterplots <- list()

# Plots
for (i in 1:length(CRIME_NAMES)) {

    crime <- CRIME_NAMES[i]

    arrests_scatterplots[[crime]] <- levels_scatterplot(
        df_     = crimes,
        x       = crime,
        y       = "Shootings",
        ylab    = ifelse((i-1) %% 4 == 0, "Shootings", ""),
        levels  = "Borough",
        title   = paste(crime),
        title_size = 9,
        jitter_ = TRUE,
        ticks   = 3,
        shape   = 20,
        size    = .05,
        colors  = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs),
        legend  = FALSE
    )
}

plot_in_grid(
    plot_list = arrests_scatterplots,
    ncol = 4,
    title = "Crimes impact on shootings in NYC - 2006 to 2023"
)

rm(arrests_scatterplots)

```

The visualization provides interesting insights into understanding the different nature of crimes and their relationship with shootings:

- In almost all cases, crimes tend to have a positive effect on the number of shootings.
- Some relationships show a strong linear pattern, such as for crimes like `Assault`, `SubstancePossession`, and `MarijuanaPossession`.
- Other relationships do not exhibit a clear relationship, as seen for `Burglary` or `Theft`.

Confirming patterns observed in the time series analysis:

- The crime of `Larceny` appears clustered into two distinct groups, reflecting the sudden change observed in the time series.
- Arrests for `LicensingFirearm` remain a crime with very low arrest numbers and consequently limited range of observations.
- The boroughs of Bronx and Brooklyn tend to interact with shootings in a similar manner, as do the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan.
- Staten Island rarely shows a noticeable relationship with shootings, often forming a compact cluster of observations with few arrests and shootings.

### 2.2.3. Total Arrests

Now let's examine the relationship between the total arrests and shootings.

```{r}

levels_scatterplot(
    df_     = crimes,
    x       = "TotArrests",
    y       = "Shootings",
    xlab    = "Total Arrests",
    ylab    = "Shootings Incidents",
    levels  = "Borough",
    title   = "Total Arrests impact on  Shootings in NYC - 2016 to 2023",
    title_size = 14,
    jitter_ = TRUE,
    ticks   = 3,
    shape   = 19,
    size    = 1.5,
    colors  = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs)
)

```

The plot confirms how the borough of Staten Island forms a compact cluster, indicating an area of the city with low crime rates in terms of both arrests and shootings.

Looking at the other four boroughs, each appears to delineate a quadratic relationship between the total number of arrests and shootings: shootings tend to be higher when the number of arrests is very low, decrease as the number of arrests begins to increase, and then increase again as the number of arrests further increases.

This pattern is interesting because it suggests that compared to an average number of arrests, shootings tend to increase both when there are few arrests and and when there are many. It's important to note that situations with few arrests and many shootings still have a limited number of observations. Intuitively, this could be explained by the fact that low police control and therefore few arrests may facilitate shootings due to lower deterrence. Conversely, increased crime rates may require a more intensive police response, resulting in more arrests.

---

## 3. Interventions on data

The previous visualizations highlighted some elements that could be problematic for modeling. Therefore, we propose to analyze these elements in more detail in order to manage them appropriately.

### 3.1. Staten Insland Borough

Both the time series and scatterplots revealed that the Borough of Staten Island is an area of New York City with a low crime rate and is generally uncorrelated with other zones. 
This can be partly attributed to its geographical distance from the other four Boroughs.

```{r chicago regions, fig.cap="NYC Boroighs", out.width = "370px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./data/boroughs.png")
```

For this reason, it is better to model Staten Island separately from the other Boroughs in order to capture its unique characteristics. 
Let's first analyze the summary statistics for Staten Island Borough alone.


```{r}

split_out <- split_statenisland(crimes=crimes, crimes_test=crimes_test)

crimes         <- split_out$crimes
crimes_test    <- split_out$crimes_test
si_crimes      <- split_out$si_crimes
si_crimes_test <- split_out$si_crimes_test

rm(split_out)

```

```{r}
summary(si_crimes)
```

The data confirm what was previously indicated by the visualizations, with the number of shootings and arrests tending to be very low.

In summary, the highlighted data are sufficient to justify modeling the Borough of Staten Island separately.


### 3.2. Outliers

One potential issue that may arise during modeling is the presence of noisy data points, which are observations that deviate significantly from the distribution of other observations and could have a negative impact on the model. Since we are working with time series data, simply eliminating outliers is not a viable option. Instead, we need a more sophisticated strategy. Once outliers are identified, we can apply a transformation to bring them closer to the expected distribution, thereby reducing their impact on the modeling process.

To achieve this, we utilize Time Series Analysis techniques that decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals, and identify outliers in the residuals with particularly high or low values. These values are updated through linear interpolation between the preceding and following values.

Let's visualize the proposed changes for the time series concerning shootings.

```{r}

palette_outlier <- PALETTE$outliers

for(y in c("Shootings", CRIME_NAMES)) {

    outliers_plots <- list()

    for(borough in levels(crimes$Borough)) {

        palette_outlier$ts <- PALETTE$boroughs[[borough]]

        outliers_out <- outliers_diagnostic(
            df_ = crimes[crimes$Borough == borough,],
            y = y,
            colors = palette_outlier,
            title = borough,
            ylab = "Shootings incidents"
        )

        outliers_plots[[borough]] <- outliers_out$plot
        

        crimes <- replace_outliers(
            df_=crimes,
            y = y,
            outliers = outliers_out$outliers,
            level=borough
        )

    }

    if(y == "Shootings") {
        grid.arrange(
            grobs = outliers_plots,
            ncol = 2,
            top = textGrob(
                paste(y, "outliers detection"), 
                gp = gpar(fontsize = 14, fontface = "bold")
            )
        )
    }
    

}

crimes$TotArrests <- rowSums(crimes[, CRIME_NAMES], na.rm = TRUE)

```

For what concerns shootings, the two outliers found refer to the summer of 2020 in Brooklyn. According to news reports, the summer of 2020 was particularly violent in New York City, with a spike in shootings and homicides. More information can be found in this [NYC article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/nyregion/nyc-shootings-murders.html). Therefore, these two outliers are justified by the unique circumstances of that year.

### 3.3. Larceny clusters

An emerging pattern that warrants further investigation is the dual nature of larceny crimes. Let's see if the two clusters observed in the scatterplot reflect the sudden trend change that occurred in 2014.

```{r}

plot_in_grid(
    list(
        "ts" <- plot_multiple_ts(
            df_ts = ts_borough_reshape(
                df_ = crimes[, c("Borough", "Year", "MonthName", "Larceny")],
                crime_type = "Larceny"
            ),
            group  = "Borough",
            xlab   = "Year",
            ylab   = "Arrests",
            title  = "Larceny in NYC - 2006 to 2021",
            lwd    = 0.6,
            colors = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs),
            ticks  = 8,
            legend = FALSE
        ),
        "scatter" <- levels_scatterplot(
            df_     = crimes,
            x       = "Larceny",
            y       = "Shootings",
            xlab    = "Larceny",
            ylab    = "Shootings incidents",
            levels  = "Borough",
            title   = "Larceny arrests and Shootings",
            title_size = 16,
            jitter_ = TRUE,
            ticks   = 10,
            shape   = 19,
            size    = 2,
            legend  = FALSE,
            colors  = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs)
        )
    ),
    ncol = 2,
    height = 0.1
)


```

This sudden change suggests not only a spike in larceny crimes but also possibly a different bureaucratic policy for recording this type of crime. The nature of the arrests clearly exhibits two distinct periods, which can be particularly problematic if this distinction is not explicitly addressed. 
The most effective example is Simpson's paradox, where two clusters positively correlated with the predictor produce a contrary effect if not correctly identified, as illustrated for the Borough of Bronx.

```{r}

for(level in levels(crimes$Borough)) {

    df_level <- crimes[crimes$Borough == level, ]
    df_level$Period <- as.factor(ifelse(
        df_level$Year %in% 2014:2019, "A", "B"
    ))

    
}

df_level <- crimes[crimes$Borough == "Bronx", ]
df_level$Period <- as.factor(ifelse(
    df_level$Year %in% 2014:2019, "A", "B"
))

fit1 <- lm(Shootings ~ Larceny, data = df_level)

fit2 <- lm(Shootings ~ Larceny + Period, data = df_level)

grid.arrange(
    grobs = list(
        fit1 = plot_model_prediction(
            df_=df_level,
            model=fit1,
            points_size = 2,
            col = "#133591", col_points = "#153283",
            xlab = "Larceny arrests", ylab = "Shootings incidents",
            x="Larceny", y="Shootings"
        ),
        fit2 = plot_model_prediction_per_level(
            df_=df_level,
            model=fit2,
            x="Larceny", y="Shootings", levels="Period",
            points_size = 2,
            colors  = c("#153283", "#ff7300"),
            xlab = "Larceny arrests", ylab = "Shootings incidents",
            legend = FALSE
        )
    ),
    ncol = 2,
    top = grid::textGrob(
        "Larceny in NYC (Bronx) - Simpson Paradox", 
        gp = grid::gpar(fontsize = 16, fontface = "bold")
    )
)

rm(fit1, fit2, df_level)


```

Despite the sudden change appearing to have stabilized in the time series, handling such phenomena with unseen data requires a delicate approach. The example previously mentioned, like Simpson's paradox, places this predictor in a particularly precarious position in statistical applications such as stepwise regression or LASSO, where forcing interaction between predictors is not feasible.

For this reason, we prefer to exclude this predictor from the prediction model.

## 4. Crimes multicollienarity

Particular importance during modeling should be given to the multicollinearity of predictors. Reflecting a unique condition of the city and often involving overlapping areas of crime that may influence each other, it is necessary to delve into and quantify their degree of correlation.

### 4.1. Variance Inflation Factor

To achieve this, we use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), an index that measures the degree of multicollinearity among predictors in a model. We then fit a model that includes all arrests for different crimes as predictors (note that we must exclude the total number of crimes from these, as it is perfectly explained and makes the correlation matrix singular).

```{r}

full_model <- lm(
    Shootings ~ .,
    data = crimes[, c("Shootings", CRIME_NAMES)]
)

summary(full_model)
```

Most of the predictors are significant, but the signs of the coefficients are both positive and negative. Let's analyze the effects that the predictors have on the response variable.

```{r fig.width=14, fig.height=14}

plot(allEffects(full_model))
```

Excluding Larceny, which we know has an anomalous nature, we would expect the other predictors to have a positive effect on the number of shootings. However, this is not always observed in the visualization, which may indicate possible multicollinearity among the predictors. Let's formally verify this using the VIF.

```{r}
invisible(vif_diagnostic(full_model) )

rm(full_model)
```

The VIF confirms what was already suspected, namely that there is some multicollinearity among the predictors under examination.

### 4.2. Correlation Matrix

Another piece of information we can use to better understand the interactions among predictors is the correlation matrix among them.

```{r}
plot_correlation_matrix(
    df = crimes[, c("Shootings", "TotArrests", CRIME_NAMES)],
    title = "NYC Crimes arrests correlation"
)
```

Excluding arrests for larceny, which we know are particularly problematic, arrests for homicide show a negative correlation with most other crimes, but not with shootings. 

It is evident, however, that for some groups of crimes, the correlation is very strong, such as between `Assault` and `WeaponPossession`, or between `MarijuanaPossession` and `SubstancePossession`.


### 4.3 Collinear scatterplots

Let's analyze in more detail the relationship among predictors with a VIF greater than 2.5.


```{r}
COLLINEAR <- c(
    "Assault", 
    "Mischief", 
    "MarijuanaPossession", 
    "Robbery", 
    "SubstancePossession",
    "WeaponPossession"
)

plot(crimes[, COLLINEAR])
```

The plot shows the clear linear relationship among predictors, which is necessarily problematic for modeling. To address this issue, we can aggregate predictors into groups of crimes to reduce the number of predictors and their collinearity. Of particular interest here is the observation that only `MarijuanaPossession` and `SubstancePossession` exhibit a cloud of points a part from the center of mass, possibly indicating a specific Borough that appears to be distinct from the other ones.

### 4.4 Principal Component Analysis

Another technique that can help us understand the structure of the data is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize relationships among predictors in a two-dimensional plane.

#### 4.4.1 Explained variance

The first two principal components cumulatively explain approximately $85\%$ of the total variance in the data.
```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}

pca_analysis(
    df_          = crimes,
    features     = c(CRIME_NAMES, "Shootings"),
    levels       = "Borough",
    vars         = FALSE,
    individual   = FALSE,
    biplot       = FALSE
)

```


#### 4.4.2 Variables

The visualization of crimes provides an insight into the contribution of a specific predictor, which is slightly lower for some predictors, especially for `Theft`, but overall balanced.
Moreover, it is possible to notice how most of the predictors known to have collinearity issues tend to distribute along the positive direction of the first component. It is important to note that along with them, there is also the variable Shootings, our response variable.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}

pca_analysis(
    df_          = crimes,
    features     = c(CRIME_NAMES, "Shootings"),
    levels       = "Borough",
    explained    = FALSE,
    individual   = FALSE,
    biplot       = FALSE,
    variables    = "Crimes arrests - PCA",
)

```


#### 4.4.3 Biplot

Finally, the biplot accompanies the visualization of variables with that of observations, showing how different Boroughs are distributed along the two principal components.
Queens Borough is the one that deviates most from the others, while most crimes tend to align in the direction of Manhattan, particularly the collinear predictors.
The visualization also partially confirms similarities between pairs of Boroughs: Brooklyn and Bronx, Manhattan and Queens.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}

pca_analysis(
    df_          = crimes,
    features     = c(CRIME_NAMES, "Shootings"),
    levels       = "Borough",
    explained    = FALSE,
    vars         = FALSE,
    individual   = FALSE,
    biplot_title = "PCA - Crimes in NYC"
)
```


### 4.5 Domain knowledge

One last interesting aspect to understand the interaction between predictors is certainly to consider the nature of crimes and how they may influence each other. Let's therefore look at the definitions of the crimes.


| Crime                   | Definition                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assault                 | An intentional act of causing physical injury to another person, including various degrees of assault                    |
| Burglary                | The unlawful entry into a building or residential or commercial area with the intent to commit a crime                   |
| Drug Paraphernalia      | The possession, sale, or distribution of tools used for the consumption, production, or sale of narcotics                |
| Larceny                 | The unlawful taking of another person's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of their possessions   |
| Licensing Firearm       | The possession, use, or distribution of firearms without the necessary license or in violation of firearm licensing laws |
| Marijuana Possession    | The unlawful possession, sale, or distribution of marijuana                                                              |
| Mischief                | The intentional destruction or damage to another person's property                                                       |
| Murder                  | The intentional and unlawful killing of another person                                                                   |
| Robbery                 | The use of force or threat of force to take property from another person                                                 |
| Substance Possession    | The unlawful possession, sale, or distribution of controlled substances                                                  |
| Theft                   | The unlawful use of services without due payment                                                                         |
| Weapon Possession       | The unlawful possession, use, or distribution of weapons                                                                 |


#### 4.6 Aggregating families

Based on what has emerged, we decide to aggregate the following crimes by summing their arrests:

- `ViolenceAndDisruption` will collectively represent `Assault`, `Mischief`, and `Robbery`, which we know from the scatterplot are particularly linearly correlated with each other.
- `DrugRelated` will combine `MarijuanaPossession`, `SubstancePossession`, and `DrugParaphernalia`, all closely related to drug sale.
- We will remove the feature `Larceny`, as discussed earlier, and also `WeaponPossession`, as it is closely related and can be explained in terms of arrests for `Assault` and `Robbery`.


```{r}

for(fam_name in names(CRIME_FAMILIES)) {

    cols <- CRIME_FAMILIES[[fam_name]]

    if(length(cols) == 1) {
        crimes[[fam_name]] <- crimes[[cols[1]]]
    } else {
        crimes[[fam_name]] <- rowSums(crimes[, cols])
    }

    for (col in cols) {
        crimes[[col]] <- NULL
    }


    CRIME_NAMES <- c(CRIME_NAMES, fam_name)
    CRIME_NAMES <- CRIME_NAMES[!CRIME_NAMES %in% cols]
}

crimes$Drop <- NULL
CRIME_NAMES <- CRIME_NAMES[!CRIME_NAMES %in% "Drop"]
```

Once this aggregation is performed, we recalculate the VIF to verify that collinearity has been reduced.
```{r}

full_model <- lm(
    Shootings ~ .,
    data = crimes[, c("Shootings", CRIME_NAMES)]
)

vif_diagnostic(full_model) 

rm(full_model)

```

Multicollinearity has been significantly reduced, although as expected, crimes related to assault and drug-related offenses remain correlated, belonging to distinct crime categories in terms of interpretation preference.

## 5. Boroughs and time

Finally, let's investigate the relationship between predictors related to spatial and temporal conditions, namely Borough, month, and year.

### 5.1. Boroughs

From the boxplot, it can be observed a similarity between Manhattan and Queens, and how the areas of Brooklyn and Bronx, where there are more shootings, also exhibit greater variability.


```{r}

plot_boxplot(
    crimes, "Borough", "Shootings", "Shootings by Borough",
    colors = unlist(PALETTE$boroughs)
)
```


### 5.2. Year

Regarding the year, a trend can be observed leading to a downturn in 2018 followed by a rise from 2020 onwards. Similar to the Boroughs, a higher number of shootings corresponds to greater variability.

```{r}
crimes$Year <- as.factor(crimes$Year)
plot_boxplot(
    crimes, "Year", "Shootings", "Shootings by Year",
    colors = colorRampPalette(c('darkgreen', 'lightgreen'))(16)
)
crimes$Year <- as.numeric(crimes$Year) + 2005
```


### 5.3. Month

The boxplot highlights a clear seasonal effect, with crimes tending to be higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, with a notable dip in February. Once again, a higher number of shootings corresponds to greater variability.


```{r}
plot_boxplot(
    crimes, "MonthName", "Shootings", "Shootings by Year",
    colors = colorRampPalette(c('#c44e00', '#eebf82'))(12)
)

```


## 6. Conclusion

This report has allowed for better data engineering in preparation for analysis. We have learned that:

- Boroughs reflect a similar pattern of criminality but occur at different scales.
- There is a trend over the years for shootings.
- Seasonality is significant.
- Crime families are connected in different ways with shootings; notably, `ViolenceAndDisruption` and `DrugRelated` show some degree of collinearity.
- The interaction between shootings and the total number of arrests exhibits a quadratic effect, where shootings tend to increase with either very few or very many arrests.
